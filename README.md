# AutomatedEmails
A Python project that sends automated emails.


Has the capability to send mass emails or selectively choose recipients based on user-provided parameters.
Apart from the email selection it composes each email with the personal data of each receiver (Name, DoB, etc).
Google Docs serves as the database, allowing for easy and flexible editing from anywhere at any time.


This is an almost ready to work code. Just replace all the required strings noted inside the code (e.g REPLACE . . .)
